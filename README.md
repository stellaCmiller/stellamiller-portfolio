# My Portfolio Site is Now Made with React! 
My goal is to make my portfolio site embody what I have learned so far. I'm still using bootstrap and jquery in this build, and I plan to add even more features.

## To Do:
- Transitions between views, possibly using an npm package for react CSS transitions
- View changes on scrollup and scroll down
- A Resume section with a styled version of my plain looking resume
